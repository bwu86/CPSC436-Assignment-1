            <p>
                I'm a second-degree student at UBC studying computer science with an interest in machine learning
                and computer vision. Before attending UBC, I attended UWO, where I received a BMSc in interdisciplinary
                medical sciences.

                You can find me out and about in coffee shops, art shows, or just wandering the city.
                If there's a Raptors game on, you can bet your bottom dollar I'm watching it. Thanks for checking out my project!
